NOW:

- [linux] capitalize all ASCII symbols from keypresses
- fix a memory leak when deleting areas if there is one
- find a faster way to rasterize triangles
- find a faster way to draw
- properly outline triangles
- try to update before drawing to remove the lag between different areas
- use 2 light sources (maybe even point ones)
- drawing a silhouette of the selected model
- drag models without manipulator
- make some text appear on the screen
- add the model move manipulator
- move models along the axis using the manipulator
- debug info output onto the screen
- don't expect obj files to include normals
- clipping
- scene graph - research
- scene graph - implementation
- [bug] cursor moves when trying to split an area


SOMEDAY:
- [linux] window resize
- don't redraw areas unless something is happening
- fix visible back faces on the cube
- scale and rotate manipulators
- shortcut numpad keys to change orientation
- a panel with buttons to add primitives
- use quaternions for model orientation
- save scenes (and models)
- nice icons for splitting and removing

- Warp cursor pointer when rotating
- Fix the blue axis in the corner
- Allocate max size and no more glitches on resize please
- Logging


IDEAS:
- don't transform the same vertex a few times



==============================================================================
DONE:

[02/01/2017]
- maybe don't add special meaning to keys at the platform layer?
- [linux] try to find a working solution with vsync and glx
- selecting models with mouse click
- insert a cube in the cursor position on button press
- single compilation unit
- debug rays through pixels (set camera to 0 first)

[01/01/2017]
- add cursor
- don't allocate z-buffer each frame
- vary pivot moving speed depending on the distance
- fix stretchy buffer for c++
- custom orientation for models

[31/12/2016]
- each model has its own position/scale
- [fixed] model disappears when changing direction
- more than one model in the scene
- fix the axis icon
- fix the y axis tilting left and right when rotating (annoying!)

[30/12/2016]
- fix the disappearing face at some angles
- move camera base point with shift
- vertical rotation of camera
- use gouraud shading on models (or phong-)
- backface culling for viewing direction (not light)

[29/12/2016]
- fixed a nasty rounding error
- fix occasional gaps between triangles
- fix the shitty drawing of the cube (z-buffer)
- add minimum luminance != 0
- fix ortho projection too
- lerp as a function
- make the grid use z buffer

[28/12/2016]
- fix triangle drawing
