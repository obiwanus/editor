# A 3D graphics testbed, inspired by Blender

This is a project I built for self education, with the goals being: 

1) Use no libraries and no engines
2) Use software rendering (no GPU) 
3) Use SIMD and multithreading
4) Code as quickly as possible, without thinking too much about design

(click below to see a quick demo)

The project is on hold. I am likely to return to it some time in the future. It will most likely require a redesign (a concequence of the goal 4 above)
